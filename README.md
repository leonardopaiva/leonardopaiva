## Featured Projects

Aqui estÃ£o alguns dos meus projetos favoritos:

- [MVP APP Puc-rio Basic Full Stack Development discipline https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-app](https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-app): This is the app for my project that made up most of the basic full stack development discipline of the Full Stack Development postgraduate course. This project required using only JavaScript, I thought it was great to work on it, I believe that the JavaScript in this project was very interesting, I applied a singleton-based structure to organize the modules, I created a controller for the routes thus allowing navigation by hashs, I implemented some Angular and React lifecycle hooks, only with JavaScript and I created a structure to apply the HTML to the containers using JavaScript, as if it were a React component.
- [MVP API Puc-rio Basic Full Stack Development discipline https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-api](https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-api): This is the api for my project that made up most of the basic full stack development discipline of the Full Stack Development postgraduate course.
