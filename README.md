## About Me

I have a degree in Internet Systems and I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Full Stack Development at PUC-Rio University. [Learn more about the program https://especializacao.ccec.puc-rio.br/especializacao/desenvolvimento-full-stack](https://especializacao.ccec.puc-rio.br/especializacao/desenvolvimento-full-stack){target="NOT _blank"}. I have solid experience with Angular, and I am currently focused on learning more about front-end and back-end technologies, such as React and Node.js.

### Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks**: Angular, React, Node.js
- **Tools**: Git

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

- **[MVP APP - PUC-Rio Basic Full Stack Development](https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-app)**: This is the app for my project that made up most of the Basic Full Stack Development discipline of the Full Stack Development postgraduate course. It primarily utilized JavaScript, , and it was a requirement of the discipline to use only JavaScript, without any libraries or frameworks like Angular or React. I applied a singleton-based structure to organize the modules, created a controller for routing to enable hash-based navigation, and implemented some Angular and React lifecycle hooksâ€”all using JavaScript. Additionally, I structured the HTML rendering dynamically, similar to how React components work.

- **[MVP API - PUC-Rio Basic Full Stack Development](https://github.com/leonardopaiva/pucrio-mvp-des-fs-basico-api)**: This API supports my project for the Basic Full Stack Development discipline.
